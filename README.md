# CryptoAnalysisPipe

## Using CSV files as data repositories, this is the pipeline working with a RapidAPI by Alpha Vantage to call for and store daily records for cryptocurrencies that I have an interest in.

## The CSVs are stored into Pandas DataFrames within a dictionary.
* To access the DataFrames, use: `df_dict['<Name of Cryptocurrency>']`
